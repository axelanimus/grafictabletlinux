This easy my bro, due to I'm a bad programer and super lazy, we gonna do this of the hard way, first you have to know how many buttons have your grafic tablet or the pencil(some have buttons like mine) this because we gonna set every button one by one, and because I hadn't took my shower I'm stinking, so, is or write a lot of code and do sleep to my family with my stink or I do this simple and take my shower of the month and my family don't kick me out of the house, easy choice...Let's do this simple, is easy.

First choose if you want to set buttons of the grafic tablet or pencil, just select the the device in the window list, then click continue button...Obviusly

Second will appears a window for test the buttons of your device, let's explain thismore slowly due to mostly of manufacturers of grafic tablets ignore our lovely GnuLinux system, they don't create specific software for GnuLinux, anyway we have to our Super Coders(Programmers) Heroes that build code for enable support of the grafic tablets in our OS, but here the buttons have an id number, so, for mapping or associate(Is the same meaning) the buttons to keyboard shortcuts or keys you need to know the id number of the button, you can to know the id number using xinput command in your terminal:

<pre>
    <code>
	<font color="green">
xinput --test [device id]
	</font>
    </code>
</pre>



and testing the buttons clicking them and xinput returns you the number of button and some parameters, but this is some laborius, let's do this more easy, then of select the device will be prompt a window for test(push) the buttons of the device and that you can know which is the number id of the button, remember the id numbers very well cuz. Then of test you can to click cancel or continue window buttons, then of this push any button of your grafic tablet for continue with next option(The very, very cool option)


Third here only insert in the form the button number and the keyboard shortcut or clear the keyboard shortcut assigned to that button, and that is all my little Picasso, now you can paint a Mona Lisa or any artwork that could imagine or you can do pure doodles like me.
